1. The logic inside badmain's main-line code is ambiguous and hard to follow because firstly, it does not contain a main() function, which is imperative to good and readable code. The only typing that should occur outside of any function is either named constants or calling the main function, and in badmain this is not true. Secondly, badmain's main-line code contains a global variable (winner = ''), which is problematic because because it allows for badmain's functions to have access to variables they have no business touching. In other words they should only use variables within their parameter list, and the winner global variable violates this concept.

2. My refactoring removed this ambiguity because I added a main() function, which made it so that the only typing that occurred outside of a function was the call function of main. I also addressed the winner global variable by setting it equal to the check_winner function. Additionally, due to the fact that I made a main() function, the board = get_board_from_file(inputfile) line was no longer a global variable, and I therefore had to adjust the parameters of several functions.
